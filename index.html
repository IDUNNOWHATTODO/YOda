            YODA IS THE BEST STAR WARS CHARACTER. LET ME GIVE U A FEW REASONS WHY. FIRST REASON HE IS STRONG FOR HIS SIZE. SECOND REASON HE IS SUPER AGILE EVN FOR HIS OLD AGE. THIRD REASSON HE IS SUPER WISE. FOURTH REASON WITHOUT HIM THE MOVIES WOULD NOT EXIST BECAUSE LUKE NEVER WOULD HAVE BECAME AS STRONG. FIFTH REASON HE IIS WISER. SIXTH REASON EVEN AT THE END EH NEVER DIED IN A FIGHT. HE DIED FROM OLD AGE.

    <section id="Character">
        Character Reviews: His intelligence, wisdom, and skills excel that of most Jedi Masters. His age and wisdom as well as his deep connection to the Force proved to be both enviable and formidable. Throughout Yoda's long life, he proves himself to be a wise and kind, but somewhat strict teacher.
        Great character he is. The Grand Master of the Jedi Council, Yoda has trained Jedi for over 800 years. ... He is wise and powerful in the ways of the Force, though his small size causes many to underestimate him.
